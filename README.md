# Titanic Survival Prediction Model
This is a Data Science project that predicts the survival of passengers aboard the Titanic. The model was trained and tested using a free dataset from kaggle, containing passenger data of the people aboard the ship.
This project uses a Gradient Boosting Classifier to predict the survival of passengers in the Titanic disaster. The project demonstrates the entire machine learning pipeline, including data preprocessing, feature engineering, and model evaluation. It was built entirely using Jupyter Notebook.
# Features
- Predicts Titanic survival probabilities with high accuracy.
Includes:
- Data cleaning (handling null and missing values, dropping unnecessary columns)
- Exploratory data analysis.
- Numerical encoding of categorical variables.
- Model training using Gradient Boosting Classifier.
- Evaluation metrics like accuracy.

To run this project locally, make sure you have Jupyter Notebook installed
